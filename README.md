# Personal Profile Project - U1-6 Solution

## Overview
This project demonstrates the fundamental building blocks of Java programming through six key exercises:
1. **PersonalProfile.java** - Understanding class structure and variables
2. **SimpleCalculator.java** - Practicing arithmetic operators and type casting
3. **MessageGenerator.java** - Creating and using custom methods
4. **SecurityCheck.java** - Using conditional logic and boolean operators
5. **Repetition.java** - Learning for and while loops for automation
6. **FizzBuzz.java** - Combining loops, conditionals, and modulo operator for classic programming challenge

## Learning Objectives

### Task 1: Anatomy of a Java Class
- Understand the fundamental building blocks of a Java program
- Learn class declaration and main method structure
- Practice variable declaration and initialization
- Explore different data types (String, int, boolean)

### Task 2: The Simple Calculator
- Practice using arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- Understand integer vs floating-point division
- Learn type casting with (double) operator
- See precision differences between data types

### Task 3: Building Reusable Tools
- Create custom methods with parameters and return types
- Understand method signatures and static methods
- Practice calling methods and storing return values
- Learn code organization and reusability principles

### Task 4: The Security Check
- Master if-else if-else conditional structures
- Practice boolean operators (&&, ||, !)
- Learn logical decision-making in programming
- Understand how conditions control program flow

### Task 5: The Repetition Engine
- Master for loops for counting and iteration
- Learn while loops for conditional repetition
- Practice loop control and counter management
- Understand when to use different loop types

### Task 6: The FizzBuzz Challenge
- Combine loops, conditionals, and modulo operator
- Solve classic programming problems step by step
- Practice translating rules into logical code
- Master the modulo operator (%) for divisibility checks
- Learn to think like a programmer: breaking problems into sequential steps

## How to Run
Each Java file can be compiled and run independently:

```bash
# Compile any file
javac src/main/java/Filename.java

# Run any file
java -cp src/main/java Filename
```

## Key Java Concepts Demonstrated

### Core Language Features
- **Class Declaration**: `public class ClassName`
- **Main Method**: `public static void main(String[] args)`
- **Variables**: `String`, `int`, `boolean`, `double`
- **Console Output**: `System.out.println()`

### Operators and Expressions
- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo)
- **Comparison**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- **Logical**: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
- **Type Casting**: `(double)`, `(int)`

### Control Structures
- **Conditionals**: `if`, `else if`, `else`
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`
- **Method Calls**: Static method invocation

### Programming Patterns
- **Method Creation**: Parameters, return types, static methods
- **Loop Patterns**: Counting, conditional iteration
- **Conditional Logic**: Multi-condition decision making
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking complex problems into steps

## Educational Value

This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to Java programming fundamentals. Each task builds upon the previous ones, gradually introducing more complex concepts while reinforcing basic principles. Students learn not just syntax, but also:

- **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking large problems into manageable pieces
- **Logical Thinking**: Translating real-world rules into code
- **Code Organization**: Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code
- **Debugging Skills**: Understanding common programming patterns and pitfalls
- **Best Practices**: Following Java conventions and coding standards

## Branch Structure
- **U1-1-solution**: PersonalProfile only
- **U1-1-starter**: Empty folder for learners
- **U1-2-solution**: PersonalProfile + SimpleCalculator
- **U1-3-solution**: PersonalProfile + SimpleCalculator + MessageGenerator
- **U1-4-solution**: PersonalProfile + SimpleCalculator + MessageGenerator + SecurityCheck
- **U1-5-solution**: PersonalProfile + SimpleCalculator + MessageGenerator + SecurityCheck + Repetition
- **U1-6-solution**: All six classes (complete project)

## Next Steps
After completing this project, students will be ready to:
- Work with arrays and collections
- Learn object-oriented programming concepts
- Explore exception handling
- Build more complex applications
- Move on to intermediate Java topics
